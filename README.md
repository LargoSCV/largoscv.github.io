# What is Geometric Measure Theory?

Geometric measure theory (GMT) extends results from differential geoemtry to a larger class of surfaces that are not necessarily smooth. For example, Green's Theorem from your primary school multivariable calculus course makes the assumption that the boundary of the region you are integrating over is piecewise smooth. However, this smoothness property can be weakened so that one obtains a version of the Gauss-Green theorem for fractal boundaries. In GMT, we will observe that Greeen's theorem holds for a special class of surfaces called **currents**, an essential class of objects in geometric measure theory. The general concept of current, defined as a real valued linear function on the space of differential forms of infinite differentiability class, continuous with respect to convergence of forms in a topology involving derivatives of all orders, was introduced by G. DeRham for use in the theory of harmonic forms. His work was closely related to the development of distribution theory by L. Schwartz. Independently the notion of generalized surface, defined as a real valued continuous linear function on the space of all continuous parametric integrands, was introduced by L. C. Young for use in the calculus of variations. The theory of rectifiable currents was developed by W. H. Fleming and the author of our text, Herbert Federer. 


# About *Geometric Measure Theory* by Herbert Federer

In this course, we will be using the textbook *Geometric Measure Theory* by Herbert Federer. The goal of this course is to read through the book and comprehend its contents. Federer's exposition on Geometric Measure Theory is broken up into five (large) chapters:

- Grassmann algebra
- General measure theory
- Rectifiability
- Homological integration theory
- Applications to the calculus of variations

Among the basic tools of geometric measure theory are the methods of multilinear algebra, studied in the chapter on Grassmann algebra. We use exterior and alternating algebras to discuss oriented *m* dimensional vectorsubspaces of *n* dimensional Euclidean space, in particular the tangent spaces of *m* dimensional rectifiable sets and currents. We employ symmetric algebras to treat higher differentials of mappings, for example in Whitney's extension theorem and the theory of analytic set, and in
the theory of strongly elliptic systems of second order partial differential equations.  

Federer's exposition of general measure theory features equally the set theoretic approach of Caratheodory and the function lattice approach of F. Riesz and P.J. Daniell. It includes not only the fundamental facts of Lebesgue integration, but also numerous additional topics like the theory of Suslin sets, the theory of covariant measures on homogeneous spaces, results about derivates based on generalizations of the covering theorems of Vitali and Besicovitch, and primary properties of Hausdorff type measures. Therefore, **measure theory is not a prerequisite for this reading course**, and **we will learn measure theory from the beginning, making no assumptions of prior exposure**.
