## Prerequisites

*Geometric Measure Theory* by Herbert Federer does not assume any prior knowledge of measure theory. Therefore, you will not need to know measure theory before participating in this study. Herbert Federer asks for "some knowledge" of the following topics:

- Elementary set theory
- Topology
- Linear algebra
- (Commutative) ring theory*

The only one of these topics typically not covered in an American undergraduate math sequence is commutative ring theory. Therefore, commutative ring theory that appears in the book will be discussed at meetings, and you will not need to know it. However, the caveat with that is you *will* need to feel comfortable the basic facts facts surrounding groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces (i.e., undergraduate abstract algebra).  

**This course in GMT is self-contained with regard to all those topics in multi-linear algebra, analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology which occur in the textbook.**

## Structure & Schedule
From 10 December 2022 to 23 January 2022 the goal is to cover sections 2.1-2.7. We will initially skip chapter 1. When we finish section 2.5, we will take a short detour to read the first half of chapter 1 before continuing on to section 2.6. 


## Resources and other Textbooks

The main text we will be using is _Geometric Measure Theory_ by Herbert Federer. There is only one edition, published in 1969. Its print version may be found in your university's math library, or you may [purchase a copy from Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-62010-2). Alternatively, a free PDF file of the book can be found online.

_Geometric Measure Theory_ is a notoriously difficult and technical text requiring a great deal of patience and determination from the reader. However, if you make a concerted effort to work through even just one page of the text, you will gain valuable mathematical insights. Nevertheless, the following **_reference texts_** may be helpful.

- **Chapter 1 References:**
  - _Advanced Linear Algebra_ by Steven Roman (Tensor Products, Multilinear Algebra)
  - _Algebra: Chapter 0_ by Paulo Aluffi (Graded Algebras, Homogeneous Ideals)
  - _Manifolds, Tensors, and Forms_ by Paul Renteln
- **Chapter 2 References:**
  - _Measure Theory_ by Donald L. Cohn (2nd Edition)
  - _Lectures on Geometric Measure Theory_ by Leon Simon
  - _Classical Descriptive Set Theory_  by Alexander Kechris
## Problem Sets

Problem sets have been posted in the [calendar](calendar.md). 

Federer's textbook does not have exercises. Therefore, most problems in the problem sets are routine computations and (generally) proofs meant to help you digest the contents of the textbook. 
Problems listed in the problem sets align chronologically with the presentation of material, so you should try to do them _as_ you read. At the end of each problem set, more challenging problems are marked with 
an asterisk *.
